Here is the list of things that need to be done to get all components up to v3.5

FOR V 3.0.0
===========

- Complete corpus encoding tutorial
- Complete CQP tutorial
- Complete documentation of CWB-Perl


FOR V 3.5.0
===========

- Get to Zero Known Bugs in the core (most bugs are in things relating to Win32 compatability and UTF8 support)  
- Get to Zero Known Bugs in CQPweb
- Get to Zero Known Bugs in CWB-Perl 
- Get CWB to compile actually on Windows with MinGW rather than (or as well as) cross-compiling
- Link Glib & PCRE statically not dynamically on Windows so we don't need to mess with DLLs
- Update CWB-Perl for changes in the CL API in v3.1 & 3.2 (most notably, Unicode)
- Work out an install system for the Perl modules on Windows (would be nice to avoid requirement for gcc/gmake if possible;
  precompiled binary package for Windows installation? Use Strawberry Perl?)
- Make CQPweb Windows-compatible
- Write a definitive documentation of the problems with UTF8 characters in Windows and how to get round them
- Get cwb-config to work on Windows (maybe by reimplementing it in VB script?)
- Ferret out any non-checked input in CQP for character set checking.
- Make fixed-char KWIC output "work", or at least approximate working, with UTF-8, as a stopgap before 3.9/4.0
- Complete documentation of aligned corpora (man files; perldoc; maybe a full tutorial?) in both core and CWB-Perl


THINGS THAT ARE ON THE LIST, BUT WON'T BE TACKLED TILL 3.9/4.0
==============================================================

This is just a vague list to record roughly what we intend to be doing down the road.

- Sort out CQP output modes in a principled way (one XML mode, one plaintext mode)
- Increase the limit on corpus size by an order of magnitude or several.
- Standardise the object-oriented code (class/method naming rules) in the core
- Refactor CQP into clearcut modules (to enable easier optimisation / rewriting of sub-units if necessary)
- Better XML indexing & queries: recursive nesting of elements, start tag attributes
- Multiple target positions in CQP
- Query optimisation
- Advances to the qery language (Different, specialised QLs?)
- New query features (Google-style IR searches; Queries on dependency parse graphs; Fuzzy search & phrase queries)
- Advances to CWB-Perl to all3.9/4.0ow access to the spiffy new features
- Advances to CQPweb as per its own roadmap todo-list

(NB this is a non-exhaustive list; a much longer roadmap document, with more detail on how some of these things
are envisaged to work, is being worked on)


THINGS FROM THE ABOVE LIST THAT ARE NOW COMPLETE
