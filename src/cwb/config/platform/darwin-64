include $(TOP)/config/platform/darwin

## Make sure that Apple's gcc is used (not e.g. a fink-installed version)
CC = /usr/bin/gcc

## Only build default 64-bit architecture (since homebrew's universal glib build is broken for latest glib 2.30.2)
CFLAGS = -Wall -O3 -arch x86_64 -march=core2 -mtune=core2

DEPEND_CFLAGS = -Wall -O3

## OS X Lion comes with editline library, which supplies readline + history functionality
READLINE_LIBS = -lreadline

## CPU architecture and operating system used to name binary releases
RELEASE_ARCH = x86_64
RELEASE_OS = osx-10.6
