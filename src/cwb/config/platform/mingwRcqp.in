## PLATFORM CONFIGURATION FILE: Windows on i586-compatible CPU, cross-compiled using MinGW
##

## this variable is checked with "ifdefs" in makefiles that need to do something different
## when we are cross-compiling for windows...
__MINGW__ = 1
## if a "unix-to-dos" conversion program is specified here, it will be used when creating
## windows releases (for text files containing instructions e.g. README.txt, thus enabling
## Notepad.exe (inter alia) to read them without mangling the linebreaks).
## Note that while unix2dos exists on many platforms, Ubuntu has removed it.
UNIX2DOS = unix2dos

## C compiler
# CC = i586-mingw32msvc-gcc
CC = @RCQP_CROSS_CC@

## we also MAY need the following sub-programs...
LD = @RCQP_CROSS_HOST@-ld
RC = @RCQP_CROSS_HOST@-windres

## C compiler flags (optimisation, warning, additional include directories)
## in this case, we also have the __MINGW__ macro-constant that is "ifdef" checked in the C code 
CFLAGS = -O2 -Wall -D__MINGW__ -DEMULATE_SETENV
## MinGW doesn't have setenv() for manipulating environment variables, so we need to emulate it with putenv()
## this is controlled by EMULATE_SETENV, created for Solaris but also useful here.

## Linker flags (libraries to link against, search path, static linkage)
LDFLAGS = -lm -lws2_32

## Parser and lexical scanner generator (recommended combination is bison + flex)
YACC = bison -d -t
LEX = flex -8

## How to combine object files into a library archive (*.a) and build a table of contents
## (ranlib is optional, simply set to "echo" or so to skip
AR = @RCQP_CROSS_HOST@-ar cq
RANLIB = @RCQP_CROSS_HOST@-ranlib


## Windows binaries must end in .EXE
EXEC_SUFFIX = .exe

## CPU architecture and operating system used to name binary releases
# RELEASE_ARCH = i586
RELEASE_ARCH = @RCQP_CROSS_ARCH@
RELEASE_OS = windows

## How to update dependencies between source code files ("make depend" requires this option to be set)
DEPEND = @RCQP_CROSS_CC@ -MM -MG

## How to index source code symbols for Emacs editor ("make tags" requires this option to be set)
ETAGS = etags
