Instructions to compile the rcqp package

This document explains how to compile the rcqp extension for R on a Unix like 
system, including Mac OS X.



Prerequisites
=============

Building tools necessary:
 - GCC 3.3 or newer recommended
 - the ar and ranlib code archive utilities
 - GNU make
 - GNU bison & flex to generate the parsers
 - the pkg-config program to find the required dependencies

Obviously R must be installed on your system since rcqp is designed to be 
an R extension and the compiling process needs to read the R headers.

Additionnally two external libraries are necessary to compile the CWB 
source code:
 - the PCRE library: at least version 7 is recommended.
   It is available to download from this address:
        http://www.pcre.org/

 - the Glib library: at least version 2 is required.
   It is available to download from this address:
        http://www.gtk.org/download.html

Follow the instructions coming with these two libraries to compile and 
install them on your machine if they are not already present.
On Mac OS X, installing PCRE and Glib can be done using the MacPorts
system. If MacPorts is installed on your system, you just have to type the
following commands in a Terminal window in order to download, compile and
install the PCRE and the Glib libraries :
	sudo port -v install pcre
	sudo port -v install glib2



Download
========

The source code of the rcqp package is placed in a Subversion repository at
RForge. In order to retrieve the source files, you need a Subversion
client. If the command line client is installed on your machine, just type
the following instruction from a Terminal window :
    svn checkout svn://scm.r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/rcwb/pkg/rcqp



Configuration
=============

You can specify platform-specific and site-specific settings on the
./configure command line using the RCQP_PLATFORM and RCQP_SITE variables.
Their default values are 'linux' and 'standard' respectively. The possible
values are the names mentionned in the commentys at the top of the the file
cwb/configRcqp.mk.

For cross-compilation for Windows, you should use mingw
	./configure RCQP_PLATFORM=mingw
More details on cross-compilation below.



Building and installing with R on a Unix-like system
====================================================

From the directory containing the source code, i-e the directory containing
the rcqp/ directory, execute the following command:
	R CMD install rcqp

R will automatically find the configure script, run it, execute the make 
command and finally install the package in the appropriate location.

If everything went as expected, your rcqp extension should now be 
available. From the R console, type the following instruction to load it:
	> library(rcqp)

To get a detailed tutorial about how to use the functions it defines, read
the vignette coming with the package. For this, you just have to type the
following from the R console:
	> vignette("rcqp")

Help is also available through the usual mechanism. For instance, start with:
	> ?rcqp



Cross-compilation for Windows
=============================

The rcqp dynamic library can be compiled for Windows via cross-compilation
on a Unix-like system. To do this, you need a cross-compiler. For instance,
in order to cross-compile on a Mac OS X machine, you can use the
i386-mingw32-gcc compiler which can be installed using MacPorts 
(http://www.macports.org/). If MacPorts is installed on your machine, the 
instruction is:
	sudo port -v install i386-mingw32-gcc

The configuration script needs to know about the following variables:
	RCQP_CROSS_CC
	RCQP_CROSS_HOST
	RCQP_CROSS_ARCH

The easiest way to define them is to create a configuration file named
'rcqpcrossrc' in the same directory as the configure script itself. This
file should contain definitions for the variables above. For instance
	RCQP_CROSS_CC=i386-mingw32-gcc
	RCQP_CROSS_HOST=i386-mingw32
	RCQP_CROSS_ARCH=i386
There is an example file in Extras/Scripts/Shell.

You must also compile the pcre and glib-2.0 libraries using this cross- 
compiler. Finally you also need to get the R.dll library for Windows used 
by R. Alternatively you can find prebuilt binaires on the internet, like
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/glib/2.28/glib-dev_2.28.8-1_win32.zip

These external libraries should be located in some directory on your 
machine. This directory contains the usual bin, include, lib 
subdirectories.

You specify the path to this directory in a variable named CROSS_COMPILATION_DIR
which you can pass on the command line when you run the configure script. 

You must also specify the RCQP_PLATFORM variable and set its value to 
'mingw' as explained in the 'Configuration' section above..

So a typical configuration command for cross-compilation for Windows is for
instance:

  ./configure RCQP_PLATFORM=mingwRcqp \
    CROSS_COMPILATION_DIR=/path/to/external/libs \
    --host=$RCQP_CROSS_HOST

where you replace /path/to/external/libs by the appropriate path.

After successively running the configure script, change directory to the 
src/ subdirectory and execute the following instructions
	make clean
	make

If everything goes right you should have at the end a rcqp.dll library in the
CROSS_COMPILATION_DIR subdirectory.
