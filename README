The rcqp package is an extension for the open source statistical software
R. It is an implementation in R of the Corpus Query Protocol which lets you
execute queries and perform statistical tasks over large text corpora with
linguistic annotations.

Using this extension, you can search for occurrences of patterns in a text
corpus in a very flexible manner, based on several types of data (words,
lemmas, parts of speech, etc.). The extension provides facilities for
displaying and manipulating the results of a query, building frequency
lists or contingency tables, etc.

This implementation is based on the CWB library developed by the IMS Open
Corpus Workbench (http://cwb.sourceforge.net/). You do not need though to
implement the CWB software: the extension is self-contained.

Instructions explaining how to compile rcqp on Mac OS X or on a Unix-like 
system are found in the file INSTALL.
